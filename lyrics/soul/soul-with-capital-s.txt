There's all kinds of music, everywhere you go
Some folks like it fast, and some like it slow
Some like it hot, some like it blue
Uh some like it old, and some like it new
Now I'm not liking country, and I'm not rappin' rap
Big band swing, just ain't my thing
Alternative ain't my snap
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Music makes you happy or it can make you sad
It can turn the worst day into the best you ever had
For entertainment value, if I had to choose
You and me might disagree 'cause I like rhythm and blues
Now I'm not dissin' disco, I'm not sayin' punk is bunk
I can't settle for heavy metal, 'cause I got to have that funk
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Oh, there's people who tell you to get with the times
It doesn't even matter that if your poem will rhyme
But I'm here to tell you, whatever comes along
There's something to give for everyone
And there ain't no right or wrong
If soft rock makes you lazy
Classical leaves you flat
And fusion drives you crazy
That's now funk is where it's at
Is when I hear a soulful song
I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
Soul with a capital S
Oh, I like soul with a capital S
Soul with a capital S
Sweet soul music, that's the best
(Soul) with a capital S
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
Oh, I like soul with a capital S
Don't you know that I like soul (with a capital S)
You gotta give some of that soul (with a capital S)
Yes, I like soul
(With a capital S) uh
(With a capital S) yeah
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S) woo
Yeah, yeah
Yo, fellas
Sounds like some of that Oakland music
You know what I'm talking about?
(They done found the stroke)
(Done found the Oakland Stroke)
(They done found the stroke)
(Done found the Oakland Stroke)
Ohm give some of that Soul
(With a capital S)
Oh, I got to have that Soul
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
(With a capital S)
