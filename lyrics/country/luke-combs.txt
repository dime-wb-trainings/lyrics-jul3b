Whoever You Turn Out To Be (Luke Combs)

A hand-me-down F150 might not be the tank you empty
Burnin' gasoline, the day you turn 16
And just because dusty boots and camouflage are in your roots
Don't mean you ever gotta wear 'em
If that ain't you, I don't care
Yeah, I used to love to sling that dirt up down them rural routes
But God might have a different map-dot plan for you mapped out
So what if you don't stick around this little town that raised ya?
So what if you don't cut your teeth on Jr., Jones, and Waylon?
Now it might work out that you don't turn out anything like me
But I'll love whoever you turn out to be
What if you picked up a canvas and you just up and single-handed
Painted scenes the world ain't ever seen?
Or maybe you were made for somethin' me and your mama don't see comin'
You ain't gotta know right now, you got your whole life to figure it out
You might choose a simple life, raise some kids and settle down
But you ain't gotta change the world to make your daddy proud
So what if you don't stick around this little town that raised ya?
So what if you won't bait a hook even if it paid ya?
Now it might work out that you don't turn out anything like me
But I'll love whoever you turn out to be
So what if you don't stick around this little town that raised you?
You'll always have your spot at Sunday supper that we saved you
Now it might work out that you don't turn out anything like me
But I'll love whoever you turn out to be
